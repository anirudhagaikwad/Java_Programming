Distance Vector Routing is a dynamic routing algorithm used to determine the best path for data packets 
in a network. It is based on the Bellman-Ford Algorithm and operates by exchanging distance information 
between neighboring routers. 

### Key Characteristics
1. Distributed Algorithm: Each router shares routing updates only with its direct neighbors.
2. Periodic Updates: Routers send routing tables at regular intervals.
3. Hop Count as a Metric: The number of hops (routers) determines the best path.
4. Routing by Rumor: Each router relies on its neighbors' knowledge instead of a full network view.

---

## How Distance Vector Routing Works
1. Initialization: Each router initializes its routing table with known directly connected neighbors.
2. Exchange of Routing Information:  
   - Each router periodically sends its routing table to neighboring routers.
   - Neighbors update their own tables based on the received information.
3. Path Selection (Bellman-Ford Algorithm):
   - The shortest path (minimum hop count) is chosen.
   - If multiple paths exist, the lowest-cost path is preferred.
4. Updates and Convergence:  
   - When a route changes (e.g., link failure), routers propagate the change in the next update cycle.
   - The network converges when all routers agree on the shortest paths.

---

## Example of Distance Vector Routing
Consider a simple network with four routers: A, B, C, and D.

1. Initial Routing Tables
   - A knows only its direct connections: `(A â†’ B: 1 hop), (A â†’ C: 2 hops)`.
   - B knows `(B â†’ A: 1 hop), (B â†’ D: 3 hops)`.
   - C knows `(C â†’ A: 2 hops), (C â†’ D: 1 hop)`.
   - D knows `(D â†’ C: 1 hop), (D â†’ B: 3 hops)`.

2. Exchange Updates
   - A sends its table to B and C.
   - B receives the table and updates its routes if A provides a shorter path.
   - This process continues until all routers have the best paths.

---

## Advantages of Distance Vector Routing
1. Simple and Easy to Implement  
   - No need for complex calculations like in Link-State Routing.
2. Efficient for Small Networks  
   - Works well in networks with limited routers.
3. Automatic Route Updates  
   - Adapts to topology changes automatically.

---

## Disadvantages of Distance Vector Routing
1. Slow Convergence  
   - Takes time to stabilize after network changes.
2. Count to Infinity Problem  
   - Routing loops occur when incorrect information propagates indefinitely.
   - Example: If a link fails, the routers may keep increasing hop counts indefinitely.
3. High Bandwidth Usage  
   - Routing updates are sent periodically, increasing network traffic.

---

## Solutions to Distance Vector Issues
1. Split Horizon  
   - Prevents routing loops by not sending route updates back to the source router.
2. Poison Reverse  
   - Advertises a failed route with infinity (âˆž) metric to stop count-to-infinity.
3. Triggered Updates  
   - Sends updates immediately when a route changes instead of waiting for periodic updates.
4. Hold-Down Timers  
   - Prevents routers from accepting incorrect updates for a certain time.

---

## Examples of Distance Vector Protocols
1. Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
   - Uses hop count as a metric (maximum 15 hops).
   - Updates every 30 seconds.
2. Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
   - Developed by Cisco, supports multiple metrics like bandwidth and delay.

## Comparison: Distance Vector vs. Link-State Routing
| Feature | Distance Vector Routing | Link-State Routing |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Routing Information | Only from neighbors | Full network topology |
| Algorithm | Bellman-Ford | Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm |
| Speed of Convergence | Slow | Fast |
| Resource Usage | Low | High (More CPU & Memory) |
| Loop Prevention | Uses Split Horizon, Poison Reverse | Uses Shortest Path Tree |

---

## Conclusion
Distance Vector Routing is a simple and effective routing method for small networks but struggles with scalability and slow convergence. 
Modern networks prefer Link-State Routing (e.g., OSPF) for better efficiency.
