### Shallow Copy:
Copies field values as is, meaning that if the object contains references to other objects, 
the references are copied instead of the actual objects.
Any modifications to the referenced objects in one copy will affect the other.

### Deep Copy:
Creates a completely independent copy, including copies of referenced objects.
Modifications to the copied object wonâ€™t affect the original object.

## 2) Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy
| Feature          | Shallow Copy | Deep Copy |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Definition       | Copies object references, meaning changes in copied object affect the original. | Creates a completely new object with new copies of original values. |
| Memory Usage     | Less, as it only copies references. | More, as it duplicates all values. |
| Performance      | Faster, since only references are copied. | Slower, as deep copies require extra processing. |
| Used In          | Default behavior of `clone()` method in `Object` class. | When independent copies are needed, such as in multi-threaded environments. |
| Implementation   | Uses `Object.clone()` method. | Requires implementing `Cloneable` and manually copying objects. |
