/*
In Java, `TreeSet` is a class that implements the `SortedSet` interface and represents a collection of elements stored in a sorted order. It is part of the Java Collections Framework and is available in the `java.util` package.

Here are some key characteristics and features of `TreeSet`:

1. Sorted Order: `TreeSet` maintains the elements in a sorted order. By default, it uses the natural ordering of the elements. Alternatively, you can provide a custom `Comparator` during TreeSet creation to specify a custom sorting order.

2. Unique Elements: `TreeSet` does not allow duplicate elements. It ensures that each element in the set is unique based on the comparison criteria.

3. Red-Black Tree: Internally, `TreeSet` uses a self-balancing binary search tree called a red-black tree to store and organize the elements. This data structure ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n).

4. Performance: `TreeSet` provides efficient operations for adding, removing, and searching for elements in a sorted set. However, the performance may degrade if the number of elements becomes significantly large due to the underlying balanced tree structure.

5. Navigable Set: `TreeSet` implements the `NavigableSet` interface, which extends the `SortedSet` interface. This allows you to perform various navigational operations such as finding the closest elements, getting subsets, and performing range-based queries.

6. Null Values: `TreeSet` does not allow `null` elements. All elements must be non-null. If you attempt to add a `null` element, it will throw a `NullPointerException`.

7. Ordering and Comparator: As mentioned earlier, `TreeSet` stores elements in a sorted order. You can rely on the natural ordering of elements or provide a custom `Comparator` to define a specific sorting order. The `Comparator` is used for comparison purposes when inserting, removing, and searching for elements.

8. Iteration and Traversal: You can iterate over the elements in a `TreeSet` using iterators or enhanced for-each loops. The elements will be traversed in the sorted order.

When should you use `TreeSet`?

- When you need a collection that maintains elements in a sorted order.
- When you want to perform efficient searching, insertion, and removal of elements based on their natural or custom order.
- When you need to perform navigational operations such as finding closest elements or getting subsets of elements.
- When duplicate elements should be automatically removed.

`TreeSet` provides a sorted set implementation in Java that ensures elements are maintained in a specific order. It offers efficient operations for adding, removing, and searching elements, making it suitable for scenarios where you need a sorted collection or need to perform navigational operations.
