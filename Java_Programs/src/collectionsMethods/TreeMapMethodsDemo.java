/*
In Java, `TreeMap` is a class that implements the `SortedMap` interface and represents a collection of key-value pairs sorted by the keys. It is part of the Java Collections Framework and is available in the `java.util` package.

Here are some key characteristics and features of `TreeMap`:

1. Sorted Order: `TreeMap` maintains the elements in a sorted order based on the natural ordering of the keys or a custom comparator provided during TreeMap creation. The keys are arranged in ascending order by default.

2. Key-Value Mapping: `TreeMap` allows you to store and retrieve values based on associated keys. Each key in the TreeMap is unique, meaning that it can only have one corresponding value. However, different keys can have the same value.

3. Red-Black Tree: Internally, `TreeMap` uses a self-balancing binary search tree called a red-black tree to store and organize the key-value pairs. This data structure ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n).

4. Performance: `TreeMap` provides efficient operations for adding, removing, and searching for elements based on the keys. The time complexity for basic operations such as `put()`, `get()`, `containsKey()`, and `remove()` is O(log n). However, the actual performance can be affected by factors such as the number of elements and the quality of the comparator.

5. Navigable Map: `TreeMap` implements the `NavigableMap` interface, which extends the `SortedMap` interface. This allows you to perform various navigational operations such as finding the closest keys, getting subsets based on key ranges, and performing range-based queries.

6. Null Keys: `TreeMap` does not allow `null` keys. All keys must be non-null. If you attempt to add a `null` key, it will throw a `NullPointerException`.

7. Null Values: `TreeMap` allows the inclusion of `null` values. This means you can store `null` values associated with keys in a `TreeMap`.

8. Iteration and Traversal: You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a `TreeMap` using iterators or enhanced for-each loops. The elements will be traversed in the sorted order of the keys.

When should you use `TreeMap`?

- When you need a collection that maintains key-value pairs in a sorted order based on the keys.
- When you want efficient searching, insertion, and removal of elements based on the keys.
- When you need to perform navigational operations such as finding closest keys or getting subsets based on key ranges.
- When you require automatic sorting of keys in a collection.

`TreeMap` provides a sorted map implementation in Java that ensures key-value pairs are maintained in a specific order based on the keys. It offers efficient operations for adding, removing, and searching elements, making it suitable for scenarios where you need a sorted collection or need to perform navigational operations based on keys.
